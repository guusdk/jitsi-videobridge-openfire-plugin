config.page.title=Jitsi Videobridge Network Settings Page
config.page.description=Jitsi Videobridge is an component that allows for multiuser video communication. On this page, various network-related settings can be configured.
config.page.configuration.interfaces.title=Network interface configuration
config.page.configuration.interfaces.info=This section lists all (non-loopback) interfaces that are detected on the server. Here, you can configure which interfaces are allowed be used by the videobridge.
config.page.configuration.interfaces.allow=Allow
config.page.configuration.interfaces.allow-all=Allow all interfaces to be used.
config.page.configuration.interfaces.allow-specific=Allow the interfaces that are enabled in this list to used:
config.page.configuration.interfaces.interface-down=(appears to be down)
config.page.configuration.addresses.title=IP Address configuration
config.page.configuration.addresses.info=This section lists all addresses related to network interfaces that are detected on this server. Here, you can configure which addresses are allowed to be used by the videobridge.
config.page.configuration.addresses.allow=Allow
config.page.configuration.addresses.allow-all=Allow all addresses to be used.
config.page.configuration.addresses.allow-specific=Allow the addresses that are enabled in this list to used:
config.page.configuration.addresses.interface-not-allowed=The interface ({0}) that provides this address is unavailable.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.title=IP Address Mapping
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.info=Often, the videobridge binds to network interfaces that are not configured with the (public) addresses that are used by the clients. This is, for instance, the case when the bridge is running in a NATted environment. In these scenarios, it is needed to map IP addresses, which can be configured in this section. Mapping applies to network addresses, but not port numbers, so should only be used when port numbers are preserved.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.detected=The bridge auto-detected that it <em>is</em> currently running on the AWS network.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.undetected=The bridge auto-detected that it is currently <em>not</em> running on the AWS network.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.info=Mapping is typically needed when the bridge is running on Amazon Web Services. The bridge can be configured to detect if it's running on AWS, and automatically apply the appropriate mapping.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.disabled=Disabled
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.disabled_info=Explicitly not use this mapping.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.auto=Automatic
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.auto_info=Automatically apply relevant mapping if the bridge detects that it is running in the AWS network.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.forced=Forced
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.aws.forced_info=Forces AWS mapping, even when the bridge does not detect that it is running in the AWS network.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.stun.info=STUN servers can be used to detect and apply appropriate mappings. To make use of this technique, supply a STUN server address below.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.stun.address=STUN server host
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.stun.port=Port number
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.manual.info=When none of the other mapping techniques are appropriate, a manual mapping can be provided by filling out the form below.
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.manual.local=Local address
config.page.configuration.address-mapping.manual.public=Public address
config.page.configuration.title=Media traffic over UDP
config.page.configuration.udp=UDP
config.page.configuration.tcp=TCP
config.page.configuration.single.port.description=Jitsi Videobridge can support multiplexing media streams using a single UDP port.
config.page.configuration.single.port.disabled=Disabled
config.page.configuration.single.port.disabled_info=Do not allow UDP single-port multiplexing.
config.page.configuration.single.port.enabled=Enabled
config.page.configuration.single.port.enabled_info=UDP single-port multiplexing is allowed.
config.page.configuration.single.port=Port used for multiplexing media streams
config.page.configuration.minmax.port.description=For single-port multiplexing, the use of channel-bundle and rtcp-mux is required. For peers which do not support these, Jitsi Videobridge will automatically fallback to using the dynamically allocated ports in a configurable range.
config.page.configuration.minmax.port.disabled=Disabled
config.page.configuration.minmax.port.disabled_info=Do not allow dynamically allocated UDP ports to be used.
config.page.configuration.minmax.port.enabled=Enabled
config.page.configuration.minmax.port.enabled_info=Dynamically allocated UDP ports are allowed.
config.page.configuration.min.port=Minimum port used for non-multiplexed media
config.page.configuration.max.port=Maximum port used for non-multiplexed media
config.page.configuration.submit=Save Settings
config.page.configuration.reset=Reset to Default
config.page.configuration.error.generic=An error occurred. Please review the configuration on this page.
config.page.configuration.error.valid_port=Please provide a number between 1 and 65535.
config.page.configuration.restart-needed=This plugin needs to be restarted to apply pending configuration changes!
config.page.configuration.no-harvesters-enabled=The configuration below has all media traffic options disabled. Apart from peer-to-peer connections, video conferences are very likely to fail!
config.page.configuration.tcp.title=Media traffic over TCP
config.page.configuration.tcp.info=For efficiency reasons, routing media traffic over UDP is often preferred. Jitsi Videobridge can, however, also accept and route media traffic over TCP. Typically, the point of using TCP instead of UDP is to simulate HTTP traffic in a number of environments where it is the only allowed form of communication. If enabled, TCP addresses will automatically be returned as additional ICE candidates via COLIBRI.
config.page.configuration.tcp.enabled=Enabled
config.page.configuration.tcp.enabled_info=Jitsi Videobridge can accept and route RTP traffic over TCP.
config.page.configuration.tcp.disabled=Disabled
config.page.configuration.tcp.disabled_info=Jitsi Videobridge will not accept RTP traffic over TCP.
config.page.configuration.tcp.port=Port number
config.page.configuration.tcp.port_info=Configures the port number to be used by the TCP harvester. If this property is not set (and the TCP harvester is enabled), jitsi-videobridge will first try to bind on port 443, and if this fails, it will try port 4443 instead. If the property is set, it will only try to bind to the specified port, with no fallback.
config.page.configuration.tcp.mapped.port=Mapped port number
config.page.configuration.tcp.mapped.port_info=If this option is set, Jitsi Videobridge will use the given port in the candidates that it advertises, but the actual port it listens on will not change. This configuration is typically only used when port forwarding is used in the network in which the Videobridge is running.
config.page.configuration.ssltcp_info=Configures the use of "ssltcp" candidates. If this option is enabled, Jitsi Videobridge will generate candidates with protocol "ssltcp", and the TCP harvester will expect connecting clients to send a special pseudo-SSL ClientHello message right after they connect, before any STUN messages. Chrome sends this message if a candidate in its SDP offer has the "ssltcp" protocol. If the option is disabled, jitsi-videobridge will generate regular "tcp" candidates and will expect to receive STUN messages right away.
config.page.configuration.ssltcp.disabled=Disabled
config.page.configuration.ssltcp.disabled_info=Videobridge expects to use regular "tcp" candidates.
config.page.configuration.ssltcp.enabled=Enabled
config.page.configuration.ssltcp.enabled_info=Videobridge expects to use "ssltcp" candidates.
